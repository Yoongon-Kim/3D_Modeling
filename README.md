# Robotic-Pet
'3D_Modeling' folder has 3D model files of my Robotic pet.
  - Files in the STL format make up the body of the robot. Other files are only for faster 3D printing.

'Rasp_mediapipe' folder has files that implement the emergency situation detection capabilities.
  - 'mainRPi_v2.py' file uses Google's MediaPipe library to detect sudden movements caused by heart attack or physical impact.
  - 'fpsIncreasement' folder is for the robot's voice recognition functionality, which my team member developed.
